                <p>
                    I am a Software Engineer based in New York City. 
                    I graduated Summa Cum Laude with a bachelor's degree in Computer Information Systems and minor in English back in 2011. 
                    Based on my academic performance, I was a recipient of the HS-STEM Career Development Grant which gave me the opportunity to conduct research related to cybersecurity under the guidance of distinguished professors.
                    In my free time, I enjoy coding side projects, tinkering with the latest gadgets, creating/designing video games, and traveling.
